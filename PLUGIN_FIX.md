# ‚úÖ Plugin Fixed - Following Stash Standards

## What Was Wrong

The plugin wasn't following Stash's standard plugin interface. Stash plugins receive input via **stdin as JSON** with a specific structure, and Stash **automatically provides** the server URL and API key through the `server_connection` object.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Proper Plugin Wrapper (`plugin_wrapper.py`)**
   - Reads JSON from stdin (Stash's standard input method)
   - Extracts `server_connection` with server URL and session cookie
   - Converts plugin args to command-line arguments for the main script  
   - Outputs JSON to stdout (required by Stash)
   - Proper error handling with JSON error responses

### 2. **Updated YAML Configuration (`stash_renamer.yml`)**
   - Removed `serverUrl` and `apiKey` settings (Stash provides these automatically!)
   - Simplified settings to only user-configurable options
   - Uses `interface: raw` (correct for Python plugins)
   - Tasks pass settings through `defaultArgs`

### 3. **Environment Variable Fallback**
   - Plugin wrapper sets `STASH_SERVER_URL` and `STASH_API_KEY` as environment variables
   - Main script (`stash_renamer.py`) checks env vars if plugin input fails
   - Backward compatible with CLI usage

## How Stash Plugin Input Works

When Stash runs a plugin task, it sends JSON via stdin:

```json
{
  "server_connection": {
    "Scheme": "http",
    "Host": "localhost",
    "Port": 9999,
    "SessionCookie": {
      "Name": "session",
      "Value": "your-auth-cookie",
      ...
    },
    "Dir": "/path/to/config",
    "PluginDir": "/path/to/plugin"
  },
  "args": {
    "template": "$studio - $date - $title",
    "femaleOnly": false,
    "debugMode": true,
    ...
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- `server_connection` is **automatically provided** by Stash
- Authentication is via `SessionCookie`, not a separate API key field
- Plugin settings are passed in `args`
- Task `defaultArgs` are merged with plugin settings

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stash_renamer.yml          # Plugin configuration (fixed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin_wrapper.py          # NEW - Stash plugin interface

```

## Testing Locally

You can test the plugin without Stash:

```bash
python3 test_plugin.py
```

This simulates Stash's input and shows you the output.

## Installation

1. **Copy or symlink to Stash plugins directory:**
   ```bash
   ln -s /Users/administrador/development/stash_renamer ~/.stash/plugins/stash_renamer
   ```

2. **Restart Stash completely**

3. **Check plugin loaded:**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Plugins
   - You should see "Scene Renamer"
   - No configuration needed - Stash provides connection automatically!

4. **Configure settings:**
   - Template: `$studio - $date - $title - $performer`
   - Female Only: off
   - Debug Mode: on
   - etc.

5. **Run a task:**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Tasks
   - Find "Rename Scenes (Dry Run)"
   - Click Run
   - Check output

## What You Can Configure

In Stash UI under Settings ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Scene Renamer:

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Filename Template | Pattern for new filenames | `$studio - $date - $title` |
| Female Performers Only | Only include female performers | ‚òê |
| Skip Grouped Scenes | Skip scenes in groups/movies | ‚òê |
| Move to Studio Folder | Organize by studio subfolders | ‚òê |
| Path Filter (Include) | Only process matching paths | `/mnt/media/` |
| Path Filter (Exclude) | Skip matching paths | `/tmp/` |
| Debug Mode | Detailed logging | ‚òë |

## Available Tasks

1. **Rename Scenes (Dry Run)**
   - Safe preview mode
   - Shows what would be renamed
   - Creates `renamer_dryrun.txt`

2. **Rename Scenes**
   - Actually renames files
   - Uses template from settings
   - Creates `rename_log.txt`

3. **Rename Tagged Scenes**
   - Process scenes with specific tags
   - Add tag names in task arguments
   - More targeted operation

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin shows up but tasks fail

Check Stash logs for:
- Python path issues (needs `python3`)
- Permission issues
- File not found errors

### "CONFIG not initialized" error

This should be **fixed now**! The plugin wrapper properly extracts the server connection from Stash's input.

If you still see this:
1. Check Stash logs for the actual error
2. Verify `plugin_wrapper.py` is being called (not `stash_renamer.py` directly)
3. Make sure YAML has `exec: ["python3", "{pluginDir}/plugin_wrapper.py"]`

### Test locally first

```bash
cd /Users/administrador/development/stash_renamer
python3 test_plugin.py
```

This will show if the wrapper is working correctly.

## Key Differences from Before

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ‚ùå Called `stash_renamer.py` directly | ‚úÖ Calls `plugin_wrapper.py` |
| ‚ùå Tried to read stdin in main script | ‚úÖ Wrapper handles stdin properly |
| ‚ùå Required manual serverUrl/apiKey config | ‚úÖ Auto-detected from Stash |
| ‚ùå Complex stdin parsing logic | ‚úÖ Standard Stash plugin pattern |
| ‚ùå Didn't output JSON | ‚úÖ Outputs proper JSON response |

## Reference

Based on official Stash plugin examples:
- https://github.com/stashapp/stash/tree/develop/pkg/plugin/examples/python

The plugin now follows the exact same pattern as Stash's official Python plugin examples!

## Next Steps

1. Restart Stash
2. Check Settings ‚Üí Plugins
3. Configure Scene Renamer settings
4. Run "Rename Scenes (Dry Run)" task
5. Check output and logs
6. If successful, run actual rename task

üéâ Your plugin is now properly integrated with Stash!
